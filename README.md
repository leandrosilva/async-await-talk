# Async / Await Pattern - Task-based Asynchronous Programming

This is the companion source code for the examples I presented at Pricefy Labs' Tech Talk on SET/21.

In this repo you'll find the slides too but in brazilian portuguese. Having some free time soon enough, I'll translate them to english, as I've made sure with the code you can find here.

If you speak brazilian portuguese and would like to check my talk, you can go ahead and watch it on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywpEtLht6So).

Oh! And don't miss [Pricefy Labs](https://medium.com/pricefy-labs) on Medium.
